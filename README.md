From an evolution in the mobile payment technology: 
Starbucks shifted its technolocy to the POS system and barcode reader - which meant that the functionanlity of the wallet could be pretty simple. It needed to display a custom 2D barcode. At this time, it was innovative (2009), relying mainly on software based barcode system. By 2015, the coffee chain was processing more than nine million mobile app payments per week. In 2016, Starbucs reported 12 million Starbucks Rewards members and 8 milion customers who check out on their phones, making it the retailer with the largers mobile ecosystem in the world.

In the last 5 years, the company uses A.I. and voice computing to allow users to place orders via voice command or messaging intereface. Once the order's placed, the virtual assistant can confirm pickup location as well as facilitate payment. Starbucks has been innovative, since its inception on technology, on the use of barcodes for payments as well as a seamless process of customer to store (e.g., recharing the card in the app, confirming when order is finalized and processing payment).

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!).
Would suggest to link health data related apps and provide recommendation on the beverage that fits the costumer's health needs.  Could be based on sugar ingestion, calories. As an example, if someone is diabetic, Starbucks should recommend coffees without sugar. 
In addition, would recommend healthier choices in the food menu, in order to align fo the above statement. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
In current times, customer's awareness towards self-care and health, has increased significantly, which has impacted their eating habits (e.g., calories noted on menus, vegan, gluten free, different types of exercises) and if adding social responsiblity to the customer from Starbucks, the branding could only improve. Consequently, increase the purchase of drinks. 


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
I am not familiar on the specific technologies, but would recommend existing health apps that interface with the companie's beverages and menus and suggests the best outcome (food and beverage) for the customer. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Not sure about the specific technologies, but for sure existing technologies (apps, voice interface, etc).
